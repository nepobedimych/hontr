Hero_Bushwack_description;In the northeast reaches of the Rulian Marsh exist a tribe that have fought hard for a place to call their own. However there are those who leave the marsh, sometimes by choice, but most times by force. Bushwack is a hunter that has been living on his own for years. Ostracized from his tribe at a young age for tampering with the technology of an abandoned Dwarven village. Considered to be bad voodoo by the tribal elders, such interactions with the strange machinery was not only forbidden but punishable by exile. Bushwack pleaded with the elders saying that it is foolish to not use the power of one of their greatest foes, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. So he parted ways with his people in order to pursue his passions.  Now he is one of the most feared hunters of the southern parts of Death's Cradle, using his troll cunning and dwarven ingenuity, to eliminate foes from great distances. Even though he works alone he is steadfast in the protection of his home and has aligned himself with the Helbourne who are also enemies of the Dwarves. Meeting the Electrician and Dr. Repulsor cemented his belief that the only way for his people to survive in these changing times is through harnessing technology, and leaving the voodoo behind.
Hero_Bushwack_role;Bushwack is a ranged agility carry who excels at kiting through quick movement and positioning. Between Crippling Dart and Side Step, Bushwack can keep his enemies in range, and Jungle Toxin keeps them from juking away.

Hero_Calamity_name;Calamity
Hero_Calamity_description;Sister Arete of the Sacred Order believed Sol had set her upon a path to be King Jeraziah's Queen and provide him with an heir. When she finally mustered the courage to forsake her vows and present herself to the king, Jeraziah accused her of being a daemon herself, trying to tempt him into the sin that would cast his soul down to be condemned by The Three Judges of All and forever imprisoned by the dragon guardian Sunder. Devastated, Sister Arete gorged on poison and damned her own soul. This is what she wanted. The Three Judges sent her to face Sunder, who hoards the souls within the Vault of All Hells, where she used her mastery of the dark arts to make the fearsome guardian her pet. Now she has become Calamity, breaking open the doors of hell and unleashing an endless stream of tortured souls upon Newerth. But she cares not about this. She will kill every one of Jeraziah's advisors, soldiers—even his savage sister—until only he is left standing, and then she will stand beside him, ruling the Third Corruption together.

Reena was consumed by the spreading evil and pulled into the underworld while Eckol was torn apart by shrapnel and cursed with the power to raise the dead.

All around him, living things wilt, and he has little hesitation to destroy trees or use them as weapons.

Even fewer dare gift their own souls to the Legion, braving an eternity in damnation so that others may prosper in turn. The few who do earn the forsaken title of the Martyr, wielding a battle-ready relic in one hand and carrying the Codex Solaris in the other. To certain death they march; and some say, with more fervor than those who march towards life."
Hero_Martyr_role;Martyr is a support hero who's all about brinkmanship. Knowing exactly how much enemies can deal and what you can take and dish out at all times is key to playing a successful Martyr. Unlike some supports, Martyr scales well with tank items, and can be a big threat if left unchecked. A combination of healing, health swing, and protective skills makes Martyr a versatile and dangerous support.

Hero_Nomad_description;The battle-hardened hunter of a hundred clashes first appeared on a dusky eve, a lone messenger and executioner to the Legion from vast desert wastes. Rumored to serve no one, and not unlike the very Sand Wraith he hunts, the Nomad's stern and offsetting demeanor has yet to gain him the trust of Legion soldiers. Nonetheless, his eagle-like reflexes and the swiftness with which he swings his gargantuan blade have made believers of heathens yet.
Hero_Nomad_role;The Nomad is a hit-and-run style carry that is highly dependent on trickery and good reflexes. He is highly dependent on Mirage Strike, which allows him to either send an image or himself charging at an enemy. The additional elusiveness provided by Sandstorm and Edge Counter make him a powerful foe in the right hands.

Hero_Pearl_description;For eons, the Bubble Magi were the greatest defense the Legion had against the Beasts and Demons. Their protective magic circled the Legion cities in domes that kept the enemy assaults at bay. When Maliken betrayed the Legion, his agents simultaneously assassinated every Bubble Mage known to the Legion and burned their monasteries to the ground. All of them... save for one lone apprentice who was mistaken for a mere servant and one pet turtle who had watched his master from afar. Searching among the ruins of her home, she discovered her master's staff still clutched in his charred hands. As she took up his weapon, she finally allowed her tears to flow and her determination became clear. She has spent years honing her craft and now Pearl, the last known Bubble Mage, has taken to the battlefields to bring vengeance down upon Maliken and his demon horde.

Hero_Prophet_description;There are those who take a different path to power, one of pacts and binding. These are not the infernal pacts of the Deamons, but instead they are made with the forces that oppose the chaos the Hellbourne bring. The creatures of the world and the forces of life, death, and nature themselves all wish to have their say in the fate of Newerth. To ensure the Hellbourne are driven back into the pits from which they spawned, each will empower an avatar to fight on their behalf, a Prophet to ensure that fate favors the bold. Although the pacts started out as noble, the Prophet did not realize that Raven is a trickster and his pacts come at a cost. The power that the Prophet wielded was more than any one man should taste, and soon he craved more. The only way to achieve such levels of power was the sacrifice of others and when the Legion discovered this wickedness, the Prophet was marked for retribution. He escaped to join the ranks of the Hellbourne where his prophecies can be cast without regard for life or morality.
Hero_Prophet_role;Prophet is an extremely versatile ranged intelligence hero. His strengths lay in his early laning harassment as well as his teamfight presence. A well placed Shared Fate can alter any teamfight in Prophet's Favor!

Hero_Riptide_description;The creature known as Riptide was the finest captain of the Legion's Armada, and any who questioned her ability due to gender would find it hard to continue their insults with a slit throat. Her ship, The Mermaid's Wrath, was sailing upon calm waters when the sea began to swirl and churn. The Maw was hungry. The Mermaid's Wrath and her entire crew were lost to the whirlpool, and as soon as the top castle disappeared the waters returned to serenity. But below the surface, these fine sailors and their captain were just beginning the endless torture of The Maw. Their lungs were filled with its icy waters, which had a terrible, undeniable consciousness, and their bodies were broken, battered, and reformed in the undertow. When the Second Corruption occurred and all of Newerth shook, The Maw released Riptide to serve as a protector of the deep, imbued with additional strength whenever she feels the cold comfort of water, and to deliver the most skilled warriors of Newerth back to the abyss. If the shape-shifting Riptide is any indication of what will become of them, it is best for everyone to stay out of the river.

Hero_Silhouette_name;Silhouette
Hero_Silhouette_description;An orphaned child, Silhouette trained in the Hidden Village of the Scout, working hard towards her goal to become the greatest assassin in Newerth. Unlike her fellow scouts, she was loud, boisterous, and most of all, simply not stealthy. Yet what she lacked in subtlety was made up for with heart, attitude, and the ability to conjure a perfect mirror image of herself. Believe it!
Hero_Silhouette_role;Silhouette is a skill-shot based carry that is highly dependent on player finesse and control. Nevertheless, she is especially deadly to enemy melee and support, who she can pick off quickly with the burst damage from Relentless Salvo. Her hallmark ability Shadow allows her to create a nearly indistinguishable image of herself.

As children of the Moon Goddess, the rays of Sol burn their flesh, forcing them to construct a vessel to channel Lunari's might during the day.

Be it through strength by day or stealth by night, Solstice, the Lady of Lunari, stands ready to show her enemies what power truly is.

Hero_Tarot_name;Tarot
Hero_Tarot_description;For centuries, the Ageless Oracle has been reborn at the peak of conflict to serve as the voice of the gods and share her visions with the mortals, but to never interfere.\n\nReborn after the Beast Bone Years as Tarot, a fortune teller who travels with her caravan of gypsies through the ravaged Forests of Caldavar, she foresaw the downfall of Maliken Grimm and the opening of The Scar but was powerless to stop it.\n\nNow Tarot has visions of the destruction of the World Tree, and with full awareness of the doomed future of Newerth she cannot continue with mere divination. She must join the fight against the Hellbourne and tip fate, wavering on the precarious tip of destruction, toward life.
Hero_Tarot_role;Tarot is an incredibly hard carry that scales into the late game better than almost anyone else. Luck of the Draw is her crowning jewel, allowing her to hit tremendously hard as the game goes on. Her other abilities give her control of a fight while giving her an advantage when solo against 2 opponents.
